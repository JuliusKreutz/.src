# ST
First of all. St is a very simple [terminal emulator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Terminal_emulator) (and no, the s in ST doesn't stand for simple).
I set my [modkey](https://dwm.suckless.org/customisation/windows_key/) to the Windows key which I used for some small keybindings. 
I will use win as an abbreviation for the Windows key.

## Keybindings
- win + up (Scroll up a line)
- win + down (Scroll down a line)
- win + shift + up (Zoom in)
- win + shift + down (Zoom out)
- win + c (Copy marked text)
- win + v (Paste clipboard)
