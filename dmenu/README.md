# DMENU
First of all. Dmenu is a search prompt to either search for programs or commands. I have my own build of it because I really wanted a patch, that increases the height of that serch prompt.
You can run the "vanilla" search prompt with dmenu_run. In my dwm build I added some arguments to my liking.
