# DMENU
First of all. Dmenu is a dynamic [menu](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Menu_(computing) with a search prompt to either search for programs or commands. 
I have my own build of it because I really wanted a patch, that increases the height of that serch prompt.
You can run the "vanilla" dmenu with dmenu_run. In my dwm build I added some arguments to my liking.
